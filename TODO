# Todo

Correct the look of equations in tooltips in glade file.
Fix Makefile so only one glade files needs to be used.
Create an installer with http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php (Inno).
Update README.md to reflect latest and greatest development.
Add screenshots to README.md.

## For next version

Fix problems due to using -pedantic (Slope-related).
Run valgrind.
Ask whether Slope objects need to be freed/unreferenced.
Work out if GObjects need to be freed/unreferenced.
Fix up the processing of command-line parameters.
Further explain rsq in README.
Investigate a neat Makefile that I can use for slope and submit.
Check this: Change the types of linear_regression() arguments so there is no
need for converting from a linked list of data points to two separate arrays.
Check this: Or perhaps change the linear_regression functions to accept the
linked list as the input so the calculations can be done from there.

## Process TODO from src/

## Long-term todos

Add a check that the input file is present.
Multiple experiments.
Exporting to CSV.
