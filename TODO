/*******************************************************************************
Add a check that the input file is present.
Multiple experiments.
Exporting to CSV.
Add screenshots to README.md.
Further explain rsq in README.
Document error codes for fmf_gtdpts.
Check that there are at least two measurement points?
      (perhaps after removing the first measurement)
Add checks for zero values?
Use typedef struct dp {...} and typedef struct lr {...}?
Add support for --help and --version.
Add tests (ptest?)
Perhaps decrease the number of decimal points?

Change the types of linear_regression() arguments so there is no need
for converting from a linked list of data points to two separate arrays.
Or perhaps change the linear_regression functions to accept the linked
list as the input so the calculations can be done from there.
