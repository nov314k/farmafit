/*******************************************************************************
Write readme.

Get a couple of screenshots.

Document error codes for fmf_gtdpts

Use typedef struct dp {...} and typedef struct lr {...}?

Add a constant for where the experiment file is located.

Create a standard way to process --help --version.
In conjunction with this, create ways to automatically insert version names and numbers.

Change the types of linear_regression() arguments so there is no need
for converting from a linked list of data points to two separate arrays.
Or perhaps change the linear_regression functions to accept the linked
list as the input so the calculations can be done from there.

Work out how to use ptest.

Include one ptest based on the current set of experimental values.

Add the ptest testing framework tests.
