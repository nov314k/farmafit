Work out if G objects need to be freed/unreferenced
Fix up the processing of command-line parameters
Investigate a neat Makefile that I can use for slope and submit
Add screenshots to README.md
Further explain rsq in README
Check this: Change the types of linear_regression() arguments so there is no need for converting from a linked list of data points to two separate arrays
Check this: Or perhaps change the linear_regression functions to accept the linked list as the input so the calculations can be done from there

## Process TODO from src/
